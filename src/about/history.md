# History

Dimitri Yatsenko began development of DataJoint in Andreas S. Tolias' lab in the Neuroscience Department at Baylor College of Medicine in the fall of 2009. Initially implemented as a thin MySQL API in MATLAB, it defined the major principles of the DataJoint model. The [original DataJoint project](https://code.google.com/archive/p/datajoint/wikis/DataJoint.wiki) is archived on Google Code.

In 2015, additional contributors joined to develop the Python implementation, resulting in the [foundational publication](https://doi.org/10.1101/031658) describing the DataJoint framework.

In 2016, Vathes LLC was founded to provide support to groups using DataJoint.

In 2017, DARPA awarded a small-business innovation research grant to Vathes LLC (Contract D17PC00162) to further develop and publicize the DataJoint framework.

In 2018, the key theoretical framework was formulated in ["DataJoint: A Simpler Relational Data Model"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1807.11104), establishing the formal basis for DataJoint's approach to scientific data management.

In June 2018, the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, under the leadership of Prof. Carlos
Brody, began funding a project to generate a detailed DataJoint user manual.

## DataJoint Elements

[DataJoint Elements](https://docs.datajoint.com/elements/) is a separate NIH-funded project ([NIH U24 NS116470](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10547509)) awarded to DataJoint Inc. (PI: Dimitri Yatsenko), performed 2020-2025. The project developed standard, open-source data pipelines for neurophysiology research ([Press Release](https://www.pr.com/press-release/873164)).

Building on DataJoint's workflow framework, Elements provides curated, modular components for common experimental modalities including calcium imaging, electrophysiology, pose estimation, and optogenetics. The project distilled best practices from leading neuroscience labs into reusable pipeline modules that integrate with third-party analysis tools (Suite2p, DeepLabCut, Kilosort, etc.) and data standards (NWB, DANDI).

The project is described in the position paper ["DataJoint Elements: Data Workflows for Neurophysiology"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.30.437358v2).

## Recent Developments

In January 2024, Vathes LLC was re-incorporated as DataJoint Inc.

In 2025, Jim Olson was appointed as CEO of DataJoint ([Press Release](https://www.prweb.com/releases/datajoint-appoints-former-flywheel-exec-jim-olson-as-new-ceo-302342644.html)).

In August 2025, DataJoint closed a $4.9M seed funding round to expand data management and AI capabilities in academic and life sciences ([Press Release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/datajoint-closes-4-9m-seed-funding-to-revolutionize-data-management-and-ai-in-academic-and-life-sciences-pharma-302568792.html)).

Today, DataJoint is used in hundreds of research labs worldwide for managing scientific data pipelines.
