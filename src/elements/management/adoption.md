# Guidelines for Adoption

You have several options for adopting DataJoint workflows for your own experiments.

## Adopt independently

DataJoint Elements are designed for adoption by independent users with moderate software
development skills, good understanding of DataJoint principles, and adequate IT
expertise or support.

If you have not yet used DataJoint, we recommend completing our online training
tutorials or attending a workshop either online or in person.  Interactive tutorials
can be found on the [DataJoint
Tutorials](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-tutorials) repository.
