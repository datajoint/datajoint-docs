Availability is indicated by who is <code>assigned</code>. Issues that are <code>unassigned</code> mean that there is no one yet working on resolving the issue and the issue is available for someone to work on. If an issue has been assigned, then any additional work on that issue should be coordinated with the assignee.</p> <p>Specification: In order for issues to be properly addressed, the requirements of satisfying and closing the issue should be clear. If it is not, a label will be added as <code>unspecified</code>. This could be due to more debug info being necessary, more details on intended behavior, or perhaps that further discussion is required to determine a good solution. Feel free to help us arrive at a proper specification.</p> <p>Priority: As a community, we work on a concerted effort to bring about the realization of the milestones. We utilize milestones as a planning tool to help focus a group of changes around a release. To determine the priority of issues, simply have a look at the next milestone that is expected to arrive. Therefore, each milestone following this can be understood as lower in priority respectively. Bear in mind that much like a hurricane forecast, the execution plan is much more likely to be accurate the closer to today\u2019s date as opposed to milestones further out. Extremely low priority issues are assigned to the <code>Backburner</code> milestone. Since <code>Backburner</code> does not have a target date, this indicates that its issues may be deferred indefinitely. Occasionally the maintainers will move issues from <code>Backburner</code> as it makes sense to address them within a release. Also, issues <code>unassigned</code> to a milestone can be understood as new issues which have not been triaged.</p> <p>After considering the above, you may comment on the issue you\u2019d like to help fix and a maintainer will assign it to you.</p>"},{"location":"about/contribute/#2-what-is-the-proper-etiquette-for-proposing-changes-as-contribution","title":"2) What is the proper etiquette for proposing changes as contribution?","text":"<p>What is generally expected from new contributions are the following:</p> <p>Any proposed contributor changes should be introduced in the form of a pull request (PR) from their fork.</p> <p>Proper branch target specified.
